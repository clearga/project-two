**Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:**

* **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

* **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element to your project? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

* **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

* **Collaboration**: Did your group work collaboratively and remain productive throughout the time given? Did each group member contribute to the project in a significant, relatively equal way?

You'll be recorded feedback from your instructors. Each of the criteria above will be evaluated as one of **incomplete**, **does not meet expectations**, **meets expectations**, or **exceeds expectations**.
