## DESCRIPTION

It's time to put everything that you've learned in the past month together! For your first project you will build a full stack web application using Express, Node.js, Sequelize, and Postgres.

The objective of this project is to:

* Apply the skills you've learned by building a full-stack web application from the ground up.
* Demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.  
* Build a polished, published website you can share in your portfolio.
* 'Canadian Sorry' no games, that was last project  

You will be working **in groups of 2-3** for this second project. Show us what you've got!

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* **Express** Build an Express Application that responds with server-rendered HTML.
* **RESTful Routes** Design your CRUD routes using the [REST](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sf-sei-1/express-dynamic-routes#restful-routing-preview) convention.
* **Postgres** Persist at least two models to a Ppostgres Database. Use at least one **one-to-many** or **many-to-many** relationship between models. **At least one model needs to include full CRUD functionality.**
* **Git** 50+ commits. Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea what you changed. (And don't expose any secret keys/tokens on GitHub!)
* **Code Style** Write professional-looking code. Follow the [Airbnb Javascript Styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
* **Visual Design** Use Flexbox, CSS Grid, Bootstrap, Materialize, Foundation, Skeleton, or another CSS framework to make your front-end snazzy. First impressions matter!
* **Authentication** Enable users to store account information and signup, login, and logout. We will build an example towards the end of the week here.
* **Documentation** Write a README.md that would make an employer excited to hire you. Screenshots are encouraged. See the [example readme](./example-readme.md) for a suggested structure.

## PLANNING DELIVERABLES

See the [planning deliverables](./planning.md) document for more information on the planning steps you should take.
  * A clearly defined **Minimum Viable Product ([MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)) Scope**. What can you reasonably accomplish in a week? You've had a chance to get a feel for timelines in the first project, plan accordingly.
  * **Wireframes** for _every_ page. These don't have to be pretty; just sketch what the page will include.
  * **User Stories** (divided into sprints) - we recommend [Trello](https://trello.com/) for project tracking.
  * **Database Models and ERD** Make plans for each resource.  List the attributes you'll include in your schemas and what type of data each attribute will be. Draw an [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=database%20table%20relationships%20drawing) to illustrate the relationship(s) between models, and note whether you plan to reference or embed related data.
  * A **Feasibility Check** for any bonus feature you'd like to complete.


Once your project has been approved, create a **GitHub Repo** for your project and [add your teaching team as collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/).

## BONUS IDEAS  
If you want to push yourself and learn something new, optionally consider doing some of the following with your app, but *please talk to an instructor* beforehand:

* **Front-End Data Validation** Validate data on the front-end by handling incorrect form inputs during create/update. For example, when a form is submitted, check that a field has some text in it, or that its value is a number.
* **Back-End Data Validation** Validate data on the back-end using sequelize [built-in validations](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/validations-and-constraints.html), or make your own custom validation.
* **More Models or Relationships** Add another model to your project or create a new relationship.
* **External API** Use an external API to integrate rich data into your app.
* **Heroku** Deploy your app to Heroku.
* **Sass** Use a CSS pre-compiler to write more imperative CSS.
* **<Insert own idea>**

## TIMELINE

* **Friday, Oct 30th** - Project due and presentations!

## WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR

#### Code must be...
* Clean   
  - no unused or commented-out code by presentation time   
  - proper spacing and indentation  
* Modular and well organized   
  - use the module pattern with `module.exports`  
  - separate large tasks into shorter functions
* Appropriately commented
  - use comments to plan, but remove the unnecessary comments for your professional portfolio
  - prefer a well-named semantic variable or function to a comment

See the [feedback document](./feedback.md) for the criteria on which your project will be evaluated.

## ACCESS TO INSTRUCTORS
We will have a debugging queue throughout the week. Remember to have lots of debugging `console.logs` and have tried to look into some solutions on your own first. We will also do mini lessons on certain topics if we notice that several people are running into the same issues.

## FINAL DELIVERABLES

* Completion of the **core requirements**
* A link to your **source code on GitHub**
* A `README.md` file that serves as your **project documentation** (this is important!)
* A **10 minute presentation**, in the company of friends, illustrating:
    - Triumphs
    - Challenges
    - Words of Wisdom
    - And _3_ lines(!) of code you want to share with your classmates, copied into a seperate document.
    - Make sure everyone has a voice, run through your pitch beforehand

## Presentation Tips
* Please zoom your browser window to 150%.
* Please set your Text Editor font to at least 20.0 pixels.
* Speak up, sell your site, and how good at problem solving you are!
